Error Troubleshooting Plan
1. Confirm the Supabase Step Is Complete
Status: You verified both buckets (excel-uploads and chart-output) are accessible and public.
Outcome: Supabase credentials, policies, and bucket settings are not causing the 500 error.
Next: Move on to backend-specific debugging.

2. Check the Flask/Python Error Traceback (Logs)
Goal: Identify the exact Python exception or message. Flask returning 500 means something inside your route code is failing.

Enable Debug Mode in Flask

Ensure your .env or environment variables include:
plaintext
Copy code
FLASK_ENV=development
FLASK_DEBUG=1
This typically prints a detailed traceback in your console whenever an error occurs.
Check the Console Where You Run python app.py

Look for the full traceback after clicking “Process Files.”
Copy/Paste the error message (file name, line number, exception type) into your logs or debugging notes.
Wrap Suspect Code with Try/Except

In the /api/upload or /api/process route (whichever handles “Process Files”), enclose critical operations in:
python
Copy code
try:
    # potential failure points (chart generation, file reading, etc.)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error in process_files route: {e}")
    return jsonify({"error": str(e)}), 500
This ensures you’ll see the specific error message rather than a generic 500.

3. Verify Frontend-to-Backend Request Details
Goal: Confirm that the “Process Files” button is sending the correct payload or parameters to the Flask route.

Open Browser DevTools

In the Network tab, look for the request triggered by “Process Files.”
Check the request method (POST/GET?), the endpoint (/api/upload or /api/process), and any request body (JSON data, file references, etc.).
Compare with Backend Code

If your backend expects request.json.get('fileNames') (for example) but the frontend sends a different field, you’ll get errors.
If your backend expects a FormData payload (files), confirm the request indeed includes Content-Type: multipart/form-data plus the file or references.
Use Postman/cURL to Test

Directly call the same endpoint with identical data.
If the route still returns 500, the problem is definitely in the server logic.
If it works in Postman but not from the frontend, suspect a mismatch in how the payload is formed in React code.

4. Inspect the Chart Generation Logic
Goal: Since the error occurs on “Process Files,” it may relate to reading Excel data or generating charts.

Check excel_reader_for_llm.py and chart_generation_multiple.py

Confirm that they handle the input (Excel file, JSON, etc.) as expected.
Look for any code paths that might assume a file or JSON is present but instead receives None or an empty object.
Verify Dependencies

You have pandas==2.2.3, openpyxl==3.1.5, xlrd==2.0.1, matplotlib==3.10.0.
Make sure these are compatible. For instance, xlrd ≥ 2.0 can’t read .xlsx files—only .xls. If your code attempts to parse .xlsx with xlrd, you could get a crash.
Check Paths for Generated Charts

If your code tries to save charts to the chart-output bucket but references a local path first, ensure the file creation step is valid and not failing.
Attempt to log success/failure after each chart is generated.

5. Validate Environment Variables and Service Keys
Goal: Rule out any hidden Supabase or environment variable errors that only show up during “Process Files.”

Double-Check
SUPABASE_URL
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY
Are they definitely loaded in app.py and available at runtime?
Test a Simple Supabase Operation
Just before chart generation, call something like:
python
Copy code
print("Supabase user info:", supabase.auth.get_user())
If this fails or returns an error, the key might be invalid or scoping out.
6. Log Intermediate Results
Goal: Pinpoint exactly where in the “Process Files” flow the error triggers.

Add Logging Step-by-Step:
python
Copy code
print("1) Received 'Process Files' request with data:", request.json or request.files)
# parse data
print("2) Data parsing complete, starting Excel processing")
# process Excel data
print("3) Excel data processed, generating chart(s)")
# generate chart
print("4) Charts generated, uploading to 'chart-output'")
# upload to supabase
print("5) Upload complete, returning response")
Check Which Log Prints Appear Before the 500:
The last successful log statement narrows down the failing code block.
7. Summarize Findings and Iterate
After you collect logs and error messages:

Review the Specific Python Traceback: That line number and exception type is your biggest clue.
Compare with Logging Output: Identify the last successful step in the logs.
Focus on that block of code: you might have an unhandled edge case (e.g., empty data, chart library misconfiguration, etc.).
Conclusion
You’ve confirmed your Supabase buckets and public file access are functioning correctly. The 500 error must stem from logic within your Flask route or the chart generation / file processing code. The revised plan emphasizes:

Step 2: Get the full Python traceback.
Step 3: Confirm the request payload from the frontend.
Step 4: Inspect how the Excel data and charts are processed/stored.
Add logging to locate the exact failing operation.
By following these steps, you’ll uncover the precise line of code or condition causing the 500 response when “Process Files” is clicked.
